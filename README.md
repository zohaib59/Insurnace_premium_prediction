# Insurnace_premium_prediction

A machine learning regression project aimed at predicting insurance premiums based on user attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and more.
Just wrapped up a project on **Insurance Premium Prediction** using machine learning!

The goal was to build a regression model that accurately predicts the premium a customer might be charged based on various factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
Along the way, I explored:
- EDA & visualization to uncover key insights
- Feature engineering and model optimization
- Evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²

Tools used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project sharpened my understanding of real-world regression modeling and end-to-end ML workflows.
